# Project 1 - Advanced Machine Learning

This repository provides an implementation of the Cyclic Coordinate Descent (CCD) algorithm for parameter estimation in regularized logistic regression with an L1 penalty (Lasso).

The implementation of the algorithm can be found in the ```logreg_ccd.py``` file.
